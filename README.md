# student-loan-calculator

## Description
This is a small project that provides a function that can be used to print and plot a (UK) student's Loan Balance (i.e. the amount they have to repay) along with the added interest in the next months/years.

I made this project because the information & tools provided by the loan company seemed indequate for acquiring proper intuition for the payback amount. 


**Disclaimer:** The calculator does not (yet) take into account the amount of money that you're required to repay each month if your salary meets certain criteria.
